\section{Application selection}

\svn, originally TortoiseCVS, is a free subversion program supported by tigris. It integrates into the windows shell rather nicely and has really good help documentation. To host a project though one has to arrange for their own server, possibly for a small fee.

GIT was originally written for use with linux development and as a result one needs to install either \cyg\ or \msys\ to enable \git\ in windows. The benefit for GIT is the free repository hosting at http://github.com/ with a file limit of 30 GB available for free. As an alternative to \git\ one may install GIT-Cheetah (a cross platform application). This requires the installation of \msys\ and appears to still be in it's developmental stages. \cyg\ can be thought of as a linux simulator and \msys\ as a direct attempt at running GIT from windows. \msys\ provides a separate GUI while \git\ integrates into the windows explorer menus.

Mercurial is another repository variation, for this there is \hg. A free repository hosting server is available at http://bitbucket.org/ offering 150 MB memory.
